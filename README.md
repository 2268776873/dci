# DCI Pattern Example Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Data, Context, and Interaction (DCI) architectural pattern in C++.

## Overview

The DCI pattern promotes the separation of concerns by assigning behaviors (roles) to objects (data) based on the current context (interaction). This project showcases how roles can be dynamically applied to objects to facilitate flexible and reusable code.

## Features

- **Role Definition**: Macros (`USE_ROLE`, `IMPL_ROLE`) are used to define and implement roles.
- **Role Binding**: Roles (`Game`, `Money`) can be dynamically bound to objects (`Player`, `Consumer`).
- **Example Usage**: Demonstrates how a `Player` can interact with a `Game` and manage `Money` using the DCI pattern.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dci-pattern-cpp.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd dci-pattern-cpp
   ```

3. Build the project (assuming you have a suitable build system):
   ```
   make
   ```
   
   Alternatively, you can manually compile the source files using your preferred C++ compiler.

## Usage

1. Include the necessary headers in your project:

   ```cpp
   #include "Player.h"
   #include "Consumer.h"
   ```

2. Create an instance of `Inst`:

   ```cpp
   Inst instance;
   ```

3. Use the instance to play a game and manage money:

   ```cpp
   // Buy a game
   Game game1 = {"Chess", 10};
   instance.Buy(game1);

   // Play the current game
   instance.Play();

   // Check remaining money
   int remainingMoney = instance.GetLeftMoney();
   std::cout << "Remaining money: " << remainingMoney << std::endl;
   ```

4. Customize and extend roles as needed for your specific application logic.

### Notes:

- **Customization**: Replace placeholders (`yourusername`, `dci-pattern-cpp`) with actual details relevant to your project.
- **Dependencies**: If your project requires specific dependencies or libraries, include instructions on how to install them.
- **Documentation**: Consider providing more detailed documentation, especially for complex usage scenarios or advanced configurations.

This template provides a basic structure for a README file tailored to a C++ project implementing the DCI pattern. Customize it further based on your specific project's needs and details.
