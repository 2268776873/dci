DCI Pattern Example Project
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Data, Context, and Interaction (DCI) architectural pattern in C++.

Overview
The DCI pattern promotes the separation of concerns by assigning behaviors (roles) to objects (data) based on the current context (interaction). This project showcases how roles can be dynamically applied to objects to facilitate flexible and reusable code.

Features
Role Definition: Macros (USE_ROLE, IMPL_ROLE) are used to define and implement roles.
Role Binding: Roles (Game, Money) can be dynamically bound to objects (Player, Consumer).
Example Usage: Demonstrates how a Player can interact with a Game and manage Money using the DCI pattern.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
复制代码
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dci-pattern-cpp.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
复制代码
cd dci-pattern-cpp
Build the project (assuming you have a suitable build system):

go
复制代码
make
Alternatively, you can manually compile the source files using your preferred C++ compiler.

Usage
Include the necessary headers in your project:

cpp
复制代码
#include "Player.h"
#include "Consumer.h"
Create an instance of Inst:

cpp
复制代码
Inst instance;
Use the instance to play a game and manage money:

cpp
复制代码
// Buy a game
Game game1 = {"Chess", 10};
instance.Buy(game1);

// Play the current game
instance.Play();

// Check remaining money
int remainingMoney = instance.GetLeftMoney();
std::cout << "Remaining money: " << remainingMoney << std::endl;
Customize and extend roles as needed for your specific application logic.
